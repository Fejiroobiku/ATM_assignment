Simple ATM (C)


A modular C program that simulates a basic ATM for a single user.

Features
Check Balance â€“ view current account balance
Deposit â€“ add a positive amount
Withdraw â€“ subtract a positive amount (only if sufficient funds)
Exit â€“ quit gracefully
Validation â€“ amounts must be positive; withdrawals canâ€™t exceed balance
Robust I/O â€“ safe line-based input parsing and integer (cents) money math
