Simple ATM (C)


A modular C program that simulates a basic ATM for a single user.

Features
Check Balance – view current account balance
Deposit – add a positive amount
Withdraw – subtract a positive amount (only if sufficient funds)
Exit – quit gracefully
Validation – amounts must be positive; withdrawals can’t exceed balance
Robust I/O – safe line-based input parsing and integer (cents) money math
